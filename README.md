# twitter-clone-with-react
I built a Social Media Web Application that mimicks the features of Twitter {signup, login, forgot password, tweet, like tweet, follow, unfollow, etc}

## Project setup
```
Clone the repo and get started. Call the endpoint at /api.php. Pass in the key that corresponds to your request alongside with the other params for the request. DB was excluded for confidentiality.
```

### Deployment
```
Kindly request the database schema. 

Or use the template provided in the app file to create one.

One will need to set up the database and make changes on the sql.php file.

Write the database name and other parameters in the defined constants.
